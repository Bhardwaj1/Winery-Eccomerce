        “Penicillin cures, but wine makes people happy.” — Alexander Fleming,
        the Scottish bacteriologist who discovered penicillin, said. Wine is the
        second preferred drink of US adult consumers at around 30%, followed by
        hard liquor. Many say drinking wine helps them unwind after a stressful
        day; it is also the number one choice of host gifting. And remember,
        drinking wine engages our five senses, from hearing to sight. Owning a
        wine shop is a great way to combine your passion and knowledge for a
        successful business while earning a living at the same time. Who could
        ask for a better job than discovering new wines, traveling to vineyards,
        talking to customers, and recommending favorite bottles? Let’s not jump
        to conclusions just yet. Having an interest in wine does not ensure
        success in selling it. If you plan to open a wine shop, you should
        consider each step for a successful business. The process may be scary
        and challenging, but it is worth it if you’re willing to work through
        it. You may have some knowledge about opening a wine shop already, but
        there are many aspects that you need to put together. In this article,
        you will learn about the various steps of opening your wine shop. Our
        recommendation: trust yourself and don’t listen to all the naysayers.
        You can do it if you are thorough and if you take your time in planning.
